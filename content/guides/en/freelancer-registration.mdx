## Start with legal classification, not invoice templates

In Germany, "freelancer" is not only a business style. Legal classification has real consequences for tax and reporting obligations.

Your first decision is the path:

- EU/EEA citizen with free movement
- Non-EU applicant requiring a self-employment residence route
- Activity profile closer to a liberal profession or to commercial trade

Treat this as a legal setup step, not an admin detail.

## Residence path for non-EU professionals

For non-EU nationals, self-employment is linked to residence law. Section 21 AufenthG is the key legal basis. Do not start billable operations until your residence situation is clearly valid for the intended activity.

Prepare a concise business narrative:

- Services and target clients
- Revenue model and first pipeline
- Relevant qualifications and prior experience
- Financial plan for launch period

Clear documentation reduces back-and-forth with authorities.

## Tax registration through ELSTER

ELSTER is the official route for important tax processes. After legal setup, register tax data early and keep all submitted information consistent with your invoicing profile.

Operational basics:

- Use one business account flow (even if not legally mandatory for your structure)
- Assign invoice numbers systematically
- Store supporting receipts in one system
- Track monthly revenue and expense categories

The objective is audit-readiness from month one.

## Invoicing and cashflow controls

Late or incorrect invoices create avoidable cash stress. Build a simple routine:

- Invoice quickly after delivery
- Include mandatory invoice elements
- Track due dates and reminders
- Reserve tax money regularly (do not treat full revenue as spendable)

A predictable routine is more valuable than complicated tooling.

## First 90-day control framework

- Week 1 to 2: legal path check and documentation
- Week 3 to 4: ELSTER setup and bookkeeping baseline
- Month 2: invoicing cadence + payment follow-up
- Month 3: review advance payments, VAT handling, and annual filing timeline

This sequence reduces compliance risk while keeping execution practical.
