## Compare account models before providers

Most people compare bank brands too early. Start with model fit first:

| Model | Typical fit |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile bank | App-first users who prioritize speed and digital workflows |
| Direct bank | Cost-aware users with strong self-service preference |
| Branch bank | Users who want in-person support for complex cases |

After model fit is clear, compare specific providers.

## Legal baseline you should know

If you need essential payment access and are rejected for a standard current account, Basiskonto rights under ZKG are the fallback path.

For security planning, statutory deposit protection context is also essential when evaluating where to hold daily liquidity.

## Practical comparison scorecard

Use one scenario and score each provider 1 to 5:

- monthly base fee in your profile
- card and ATM behavior in your city
- non-EUR and foreign usage cost
- onboarding speed and document quality
- support responsiveness for urgent issues

If one criterion is critical (for example English support or cash access), weight it explicitly.

## Migration plan that avoids payment failures

### Week 1

Open account, complete KYC, test incoming and outgoing transfer.

### Week 2

Switch salary and rent, keep old account active.

### Week 3

Migrate subscriptions and standing orders.

### Week 4

Validate all recurring payments, then de-risk old account.

## Common traps

- Price comparison without full fee structure.
- No buffer period during account switch.
- No written records of terms at signup date.

This workflow gives you an account setup that is operationally reliable, not just marketing-attractive.
