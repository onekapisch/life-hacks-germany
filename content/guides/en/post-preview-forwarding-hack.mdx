title: "Mail Hack: Combine Letter Preview and Forwarding"
summary: "From Life Hacks DE: combine digital letter preview with forwarding before a move so critical mail does not slip through."
pillar: "bureaucracy"
slug: "post-preview-forwarding-hack"
updated: "2026-02-10"
forWho: "Expats, students, and professionals who change addresses in Germany."
costs: "Basic letter preview is free; forwarding service has a fee."
localNotes: "Not every mail type is previewed or forwarded. Early setup reduces missed-deadline risk."
disclaimer: "This is practical guidance, not legal advice. For deadline-critical notices, always use additional safety checks."
steps:
  - "Enable letter preview in your linked mail/post service so you can see incoming letters earlier."
  - "Set up forwarding before moving and choose a long enough forwarding duration."
  - "Still update key senders directly (bank, health insurance, authorities, employer)."
  - "Track important letters by date and sender in case delivery issues occur later."
facts:
  - "Deutsche Post offers letter preview for many mail items before physical delivery."
  - "Deutsche Post forwarding can route letters to a new address for a limited period."
mistakes:
  - "Relying only on forwarding without updating sender records."
  - "Setting forwarding after moving instead of in advance."
