## Read the contract as a cost system, not as one number

Many tenants focus only on warm rent. That is risky. Before signing, split all monthly amounts into written components:

- cold rent (`Kaltmiete`)
- operating-cost advance (`Betriebskostenvorauszahlung`)
- heating-cost advance (`Heizkostenvorauszahlung`)
- total warm rent (`Warmmiete`)
- legal due date

If these values are unclear, request a corrected written version before signing.

## Deposit rules you can enforce

Under BGB Section 551, deposit security is capped and tied to cold rent. Payment by installments is legally relevant and should be reflected in your payment planning.

Practical move: keep transfer proof and contract clause together in one folder from day one.

## Operating costs: only what is clearly agreed

BGB Sections 556 and 556a plus BetrKV structure what can be passed on and how distribution is handled.

Use this review checklist:

- are operating costs explicitly agreed in the contract?
- is the allocation method understandable?
- are unusual extra items explained in writing?

If any item is ambiguous, ask for a written clarification before signature.

## Rent due date and payment safety

BGB Section 556b sets the legal framework for due dates. Set up payment automation only after verifying exact contract wording and due-date logic.

For safety:

- use one dedicated rent payment account reference
- keep all transfer receipts
- avoid cash payments without formal proof

## Notice clauses: legal baseline first

BGB Section 573c sets statutory notice periods for ordinary termination in residential leases. Contract language should not mislead you into weaker rights.

Before signing, check:

- notice period wording
- start and end timing of notice period
- whether additional clauses conflict with statutory baseline

## Move-in protocol: your evidence layer

On handover day, create a signed protocol with timestamped photos covering:

- walls, floors, windows, kitchen, bathroom
- meter readings
- keys received
- visible defects

This is your primary evidence for deposit discussions at move-out.

## 24-hour pre-sign checklist

1. Verify all rent components and due date.
2. Verify deposit amount and installment rights.
3. Verify operating-cost wording and allocation logic.
4. Verify notice clause against legal baseline.
5. Prepare handover protocol template in advance.

Combine this with [Mietkaution](/en/guides/housing/mietkaution) and [Notice Period Rules](/en/guides/housing/kuendigungsfrist-miete) to avoid expensive errors.
