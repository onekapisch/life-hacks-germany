## Install in this exact order

Start with safety-critical apps first, then mobility, then housing and healthcare. This order prevents the common mistake of having convenience apps but no emergency coverage.

1. nora + NINA + WarnWetter
2. DB Navigator + Deutschlandticket + local transit app
3. Housing search alerts (ImmoScout24 + immowelt + WG-Gesucht)
4. Healthcare and admin (Doctolib/jameda + Post & DHL)

## Alert hygiene rules

Most people fail because every app sends every notification. Set clear rules:

- Emergency and severe weather alerts: enabled
- Housing and appointment alerts: enabled with strict filters
- Marketing and recommendation alerts: disabled

This keeps the signal-to-noise ratio high.

## Monthly maintenance in 5 minutes

- Check permissions after OS updates
- Remove duplicate apps that create noisy alerts
- Re-check transport and housing alerts for relevance

Treat this stack as infrastructure, not as a one-time setup.
