## Start with the legal route, not with a driving school package

License conversion in Germany is rule-driven. The correct first action is legal classification, not booking lessons.

Use this order:

1. Determine whether your case is EU/EWR, Annex 11, or outside Annex 11.
2. Confirm local document requirements.
3. Confirm exam obligations in writing.
4. Only then plan budget and timeline.

## Route A: EU/EWR license holders

FeV Section 28 is the core rule for EU/EWR recognition. In many standard cases, valid EU/EWR licenses are recognized in Germany without immediate conversion.

Practical point: even when immediate conversion is not required, keep your documents valid and update local records when required by authorities.

## Route B: Non-EU/EWR licenses

FeV Section 29 defines how non-EU/EWR licenses are treated after residence is established in Germany. Operationally, this creates a strict planning window and makes early action essential.

Do not wait for the final weeks. Appointment bottlenecks and document rework are common.

## Route C: Conversion under Section 31 and Annex 11

Section 31 plus Annex 11 determines whether conversion can happen directly or whether theory/practical exams are required.

Annex 11 is country-specific. Two people with non-German licenses can have completely different conversion obligations depending on issuing country and license class.

## Document pack that reduces rejections

Prepare this baseline set early:

- valid passport or ID
- residence registration evidence
- original foreign license
- certified translation if required locally
- any local certificates explicitly requested

Before your appointment, send a short written checklist request to the authority and ask for confirmation.

## Timeline and risk control

Use a simple conversion plan:

- week 1: legal route classification and checklist confirmation
- week 2 to 3: gather missing documents
- week 3 to 6: application submission and authority follow-up
- exam path only: reserve theory and practical slots early

If your commute depends on driving, keep a temporary mobility backup active until the German license is issued.

## Common failure patterns

- **Failure pattern:** assuming a friend's route applies to your country.
  - **Fix:** verify your own Annex 11 status and local authority interpretation.
- **Failure pattern:** submitting incomplete documents.
  - **Fix:** get written checklist confirmation before appointment day.
- **Failure pattern:** no backup when processing takes longer.
  - **Fix:** pre-arrange transport alternatives for 8 to 12 weeks.

This approach protects both compliance and day-to-day mobility continuity.
