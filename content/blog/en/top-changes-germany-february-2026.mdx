## Why February still needs a checklist

February is often treated as a short transition month, but legal and travel process changes can create immediate friction when ignored.

## 1) Federal legal update is live for February 2026

The Federal Government published the February 2026 legal update package. This is the baseline reference to scan before assuming January rules still apply unchanged.

## 2) UK travel from Germany: ETA compliance matters

For many Germany-based residents and travellers, UK **ETA** requirements became operationally relevant in late February 2026.

What this affects:

- Expats and students flying to the UK for work, study, or tourism
- Families making short-notice travel plans
- Anyone assuming prior visa-free workflows are unchanged

Practical move: verify your ETA status before booking and again before departure.

## 3) Property/green-space compliance: end-of-February cutover

Section 39 of the Federal Nature Conservation Act defines restrictions that apply from March for major hedge and shrub cutting. End of February is the key planning boundary for households and property managers.

What this affects:

- Homeowners and tenants with garden responsibilities
- Housing companies and building managers
- Residents coordinating maintenance contractors

## 4) Migration procedure updates: re-verify before filing

When migration-related legal updates are published, assumptions from prior months can break application timing. Verify every requirement against the current month before submission.

## Action checklist

- Run a monthly legal-change check before submitting applications.
- Validate UK ETA status for all affected travellers in your household.
- If you manage outdoor property work, close February tasks before March restrictions begin.
- Add all February changes to your admin deadline tracker.
