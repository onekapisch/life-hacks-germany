## Why this month matters

January 2026 introduced several baseline cost and eligibility changes. If you live, study, or work in Germany, these directly affect budgeting, contract planning, and permit strategy.

## 1) Work and side-income baseline changed

According to the Federal Government's January 2026 legal update, the statutory minimum wage increased to **EUR 13.90** and the **minijob limit increased to EUR 603**.

What this affects:

- Students with side jobs
- Part-time workers and households planning monthly cash flow
- Employers and contract negotiations for hourly roles

## 2) Family budget: Kindergeld increased

The same January update states that **Kindergeld increased to EUR 259 per child per month**.

What this affects:

- Families recalculating monthly fixed-income planning
- Households coordinating housing, childcare, and transport budgets

## 3) Mobility budget: Deutschlandticket now EUR 63

As of January 2026, the official update lists the **Deutschlandticket at EUR 63/month**.

What this affects:

- Commuters deciding between transit and car
- Students balancing semester mobility and subscriptions
- Employers reimbursing travel under fixed monthly assumptions

## 4) Immigration planning: Blue Card 2026 thresholds

The federal "Make it in Germany" portal published updated Blue Card thresholds for 2026. Salary thresholds and role category rules should be checked against your actual employment contract and role type.

What this affects:

- Skilled workers planning application timing
- Employers issuing contracts for international hires
- Students transitioning to post-study skilled employment

## 5) Admin deadline risk: driving licence exchange windows

January updates also included stricter timing around driving licence exchange cohorts. If you drive in Germany with an older licence format, missing a cohort deadline can create unnecessary compliance stress.

## Action checklist

- Recalculate monthly budget with 2026 wage, ticket, and family-benefit values.
- Re-check any Blue Card plans against 2026 threshold values.
- Validate your licence exchange timeline early if it applies to you.
- Update your personal deadline tracker with all new 2026 baseline values.
